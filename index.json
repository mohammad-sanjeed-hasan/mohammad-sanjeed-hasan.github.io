[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Mohammad Sanjeed Hasan is currently doing research on the field of Fluid Dynamics, specifically on rotating and non-rotating curved duct flow and heat transfer. At present, Hasan is looking for a research position (Ph.D.) in the field of Applied Mathematics or Mechanical Engineering in order to get an opportunity to utilize his potentiality, adaptability, and skills in doing innovative research and sharing knowledge for the sake of industrial revolution.\nHasan has already worked on two different projects (see in the project section) as a research associate in order to develop his research skill. Besides, he has published several papers (see in the publications section) in some reputed international journals (SCOPUS and ISI indexed). Furthermore, he has attended several international conferences and presented his research work.\nHowever, Hasan’s research is not only limited to the curved duct flow and heat transfer but also he conducted his research work in Magneto-hydrodynamics and bio-fluid mechanics as well. Currently, he is enhancing his knowledge in underground gas storage, mathematical and numerical modelling of transport media in porous media, microfluid, nanofluid, droplets, blood flow, and turbulent flow for both the theoretical (numerical) and experimental paradigm.\nHasan completed his Master of Science (M.Sc.) degree in Applied Mathematics and Bachelor of Science (B.Sc. (Hon’s)) degree in Mathematics from Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Science and Technology University, Gopalganj-8100, Bangladesh. He secured 1st position in B.Sc. (Hon’s) in the Department of Mathematics as well as in the Faculty of Science, BSMRSTU and thereafter awarded the “Dean’s Award” and the “Prime Minister Gold Medal Award” respectively. Furthermore, he secured 2nd position in M.Sc. from the same department. The Medium of Instruction was English for both B.Sc. and M.Sc. programs. He also passed S.S.C and H.S.C from Bangladesh Navy College, Dhaka and Adamjee Cantonment College, Dhaka respectively in 2009 and 2011.\n","date":1607817600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1607817600,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"Mohammad Sanjeed Hasan is currently doing research on the field of Fluid Dynamics, specifically on rotating and non-rotating curved duct flow and heat transfer.
